# ModerArtUI
# An application with	an interesting	user interface. This	 application's	 user	interface	is	composed	of	geometric	shapes	arranged	in	a	particular	order.Its	layout	inspired	by	the	works	of	Modern	Art	masters such	as	Piet	Mondrian	and	Ben	Nicholson.	This	application's	user	interface	has	one	area	containing multiple	colored	rectangles	and	another	containing	a	SeekBar	(sometimes	called	a	Slider).	When	the	user	drags	the	SeekBar,	all	non-white/non-grey	rectangles	gradually	change	their	color.
